## Requirements

- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) >= 4.7
- [PHP](https://secure.php.net/) >= 7.1
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) >= 6.14

## Theme Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nlenkowski/blujay/releases/latest/) and unzip it into your `/wp-content/themes` directory.

2. Run `npm install` from the theme directory to install dependencies.

3. Run `npm run prod` to compile and optimize assets for production.

## Theme Development

1. Edit `/lib/setup.php` to enable and/or disable theme features and register assets, menus, image sizes, sidebars, etc.

2. Edit `/webpack.mix.js` and change the browserSync `proxy` to reflect your local development url.

### Build Commands

Compiled assets are output to the `/dist` directory.

- `npm run dev` – Compiles assets and generates source maps for development

- `npm run prod` – Compiles and optimizes assets for production

- `npm run watch` – Starts a Browsersync session and compiles assets when changes are detected

### Package Management

Example of how to include npm packages in your theme:

1. Install package

```sh
npm install flatpickr
```

2. Add the stylesheet entry points to `/assets/styles/main.scss`

```css
@import "~flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.css";
```

3. Add the script entry points to `/assets/scripts/main.js`

```js
import flatpickr from "flatpickr";
```

4. Run any build command to compile the imported package assets along with your own.
